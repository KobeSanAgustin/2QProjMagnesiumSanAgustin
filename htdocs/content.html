      <h1><img src="../images/info1.png" alt="Question Mark"> What is Cyberbullying? </h1>
      <p> Cyberbullying, as its name suggests, is bullying that happens over the digital plane. It is when someone or a group of people posts or shares negative content against someone with the intention of embarrassing, humiliating, or harming the victim/s emotionally and mentally. This can happen via messaging, chat boxes, forums, and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or others. </p>

      <h1><img src="../images/info2.png" alt="City"> Cyberbullying in the Modern World </h1>
      <p> With the modern era having many technological advancements and with communication being mainly digital or online, cyberbullying has become much more frequent and easier to do. During the pandemic where almost all of the population is either working from home or having online class, cyberbullying is harder to avoid because in the past we could have just lived an offline life where we only focused on our non-digital lives, but the situation has changed and there is simply no avoiding it. </p>
