      <div class="specifics">
        <p> If the cyberbullying isn't serious and is just some trolls looking to mess with people you can solve this issue by blocking them on that site and ignoring them. </p>
        <p> Once the cyberbullying gets more severe and affects your mental health you can talk with someone you trust about your problems to help get it off your chest. </p>
        <p> To finally end the cyberbullying as much as you can, you can report this to the local authorities or people in power if this is violating you as a person. You can also make a new account or use another social media to avoid these bullies. </p>
